## About

This is a degree project as a part of my education at Medieinstitutet. It is built to use and increase my abilities in front end developing.

Project is built for a voluntary organization, **Julklappshjälpen Värmdö**. The organization is helping people that can’t afford Christmas gifts for their children. It is dependent of giving people and companies. Today they only have a Facebook group for communication, therefor this project is to give them a website so that more people can read about this amazing organization. 

**Please observe that this is a copy of the real project. This version/copy is without the admin section.**
